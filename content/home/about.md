# Biography
I am a vector ecologist and microbiologist in the Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research at the NIH. I earned my doctorate in microbiology at Colorado State University studying the use of ivermectin as a malaria control measure in West Africa. My current work focuses on the dry-season persistence mechanisms of *Anopheles* spp. mosquitoes in Mali. Outside of work I like to ski, rock climb, and fly fish (past times of all Montanans...).
