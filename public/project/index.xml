      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a project I took over once I got to the NIH looking at how the mosquito microbiome changes seasonally in areas of Mali either with permanent, year-round water, or in areas with no known water for ~7 months of the year. This work was done in hopes to better understand the dry season persistence mechanisms of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes, with hopes to move into understanding the impacts of this state on malaria transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for future work with whole genome sequencing data!&lt;/p&gt;
